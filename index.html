        <p>I love Dancing! When I hear music all I want to do is dance around. I started dancing when I was 5 or 6 years old. I have atleast 8 trophies for dancing. All of my trophies are for dancing. I am also really good at it. I peformed many times on stage. I also performed online during Corona. I dance with energy. Although I sometimes get tired. At performences I get scared if I would mess up but I do not. I really love dancing and when I grow up I want to be a dancer.</p>
